## Note: Turn off Instant Run when building

[Sugar ORM](https://github.com/chennaione/sugar), a library being used in this app, does not work well with Instant Run. You will have to turn the feature off on Android Studio when building the app. You can do this by:
  * File --> Settings --> Build, Execution, Deployment --> Instant Run --> Uncheck Enable instant run.

## Lead (sales lead)
A sales lead is a potential sales contact, an individual or organization that expresses an interest in your goods or services. Leads are typically obtained through the referral of an existing customer, or through a direct response to advertising or publicity. A company's marketing department is typically responsible for lead generation.
